@use '@carbon/react/scss/colors';

// override header tooltip color so it won't blend within the content
// (when header became dark, the tooltip became way too light)
// The tutorial was using the code bellow, but it isn't working. After removing .cds--header__global from both styles, it worked
.cds--popover-content {
  background-color: colors.$gray-20;
}

.cds--popover-caret {
  background-color: colors.$gray-20;
}
